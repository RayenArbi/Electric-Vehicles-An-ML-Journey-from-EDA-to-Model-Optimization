# Electric-Vehicles-An-ML-Journey-from-EDA-to-Model-Optimization
Built a complete ML pipeline to predict electric vehicle prices based on specs like top speed, torque, battery, and range. Performed full EDA, data cleaning, and trained multiple regression models with hyperparameter tuning. Compared performance using RÂ² scores and identified the best model for accurate price estimation.
